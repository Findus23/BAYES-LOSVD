Welcome to BAYES-LOSVD
======================

The code is written in a flexible and modular fashion, so that it be easily expanded 
in its capabilities by non-expert python users. We provide details on how to 
enhance the code with the inclusion of new reading procedures for different 
data formats, as well as guidelines on how to incorporate new Stan models.
